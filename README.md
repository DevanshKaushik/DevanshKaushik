I'm a Full-Stack Developer and a CSE Undergrad brushing up on my design and development skills. Since my high school days, I have had varying interests in many subjects such as Development, CGI, Game Development, etc. Recently, I started working on an ambitious open-source project and applying all the knowledge I have gathered from working all this time. You can always ask me about any of my projects or development in general.
